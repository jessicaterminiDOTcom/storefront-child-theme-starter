# Storefront Child Theme Starter

## Description

This is a "getting started" child theme for [Storefront](http://www.woothemes.com/storefront/), crafted by [WooThemes](http://www.woothemes.com/).

The [Storefront Child Theme Starter](https://github.com/joshbuchea/storefront-child-theme-starter) requires Storefront.

## Installation

*Note: WooThemes Storefront must be installed first for the Storefront Child Theme Starter to work correctly.*

There are two ways to install WordPress themes / child themes: via the WordPress Dashboard (recommended) and via FTP. 

### Using the WordPress Dashboard

1. Download the [Storefront Child Theme Starter](https://github.com/joshbuchea/storefront-child-theme-starter/zipball/master).
2. Locate the "Appearance" menu.
3. In the "Appearance" menu, click on "Themes".
4. On the "Themes" page, click on the "Install Themes" tab.
5. Click on the "Upload" link at the top of the page.
6. On the "Upload" page, locate the theme / child theme archive (zip) on your computer and click "Install Now".
7. On the following page, click "Activate".

### Using FTP

1. Download the [Storefront Child Theme Starter](https://github.com/joshbuchea/storefront-child-theme-starter/zipball/master).
2. Unzip the ```joshbuchea-storefront-child-theme-starter.zip``` archive on your computer.
3. Connect to your server via FTP.
4. Upload the extracted ```joshbuchea-storefront-child-theme-starter``` directory to the ```/wp-content/themes/``` directory on your server.
6. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to the "Themes" page under the "Appearance" menu.
7. Locate "Storefront Child Theme Starter" and click "Activate".

## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Storefront Child Theme Starter and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles under this section to override the styles that come with Storefront.

If you happened to name the Storefront theme directory anything else besides "storefront" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the Storefront Child Theme Starter's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
